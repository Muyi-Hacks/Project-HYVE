# Project-HYVE

The website Hyve (quhyve.com) is an online platform designed to promote student-led services at Queens University. It focuses on providing a variety of services catering to the needs of Black students and other people of color in Kingston. The site includes sections for beauty, photography, hair care, DJs, events, and more, aiming to enhance the campus life experience through diverse and inclusive offerings.

Here's how I made it!

Wireframing: wireframing was the first to see where our web design can go. Mood boards were used to make the wireframes. Moodboards only have photos that fit the vibe we wanted.
